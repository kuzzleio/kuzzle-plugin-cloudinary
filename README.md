# kuzzle-plugin-cloudinary
Here, you'll find the boilerplate to start coding a new [Kuzzle Core Plugin](https://docs.kuzzle.io/plugins/1/essentials/getting-started/). A Core Plugin allows you to

* [listen asynchronously](https://docs.kuzzle.io/plugins/1/hooks/), and perform operations that depend on data-related events;
* [listen synchronously](https://docs.kuzzle.io/plugins/1/pipes/), and approve, modify and/or reject data-related queries;
* [add a controller route](https://docs.kuzzle.io/plugins/1/controllers/) to expose new actions to the API;
* [add an authentication strategy](https://docs.kuzzle.io/plugins/1/strategies/) to Kuzzle.


The boilerplate demonstrates each feature of a Core Plugin.

## Plugin development

This plugin is useful only if you use it as the starting point of your work. It's a boilerplate.

### On an existing Kuzzle

Clone this repository locally and make it accessible from the `plugins/enabled` directory relative to the Kuzzle installation directory. A common practice is to put the code of the plugin in `plugins/available` and create a symbolic link to it in `plugins/enabled`.

**Note.** If you are running Kuzzle from within a Docker container, you will need to mount the local plugin installation directory as a volume in the container.

Please refer to the Guide for further instructions on [how to install Kuzzle plugins](https://docs.kuzzle.io/guide/1/essentials/plugins/#installing-a-plugin).

### On a pristine Kuzzle stack

You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file included in this repository to start a development-oriented stack to help you creating your custom Kuzzle Core plugin.

Clone this repository locally and type:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

This command will start a Kuzzle stack with this plugin enabled. To make development more confortable, a watcher will also be activated, restarting Kuzzle every time a modification is detected.

**Note:** depending on your operating system, you may get `ENOSPC` errors due to the file watcher. This is due to a `sysctl` restriction, and can be alleviated by applying the following command prior to starting the docker stack:

```bash
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=52428
```

#### Working on a different Kuzzle tag

You can choose to work on the Kuzzle development branch by defining the following environment variables before launching `docker-compose`:

```bash
$ export KUZZLE_DOCKER_TAG=1.4.2
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

These environment variables enable you to specify any existing build tag available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kuzzleio/kuzzle/tags/).


#### Customizing the plugin instance name

You may want to choose a plugin name rather than using the default one. To do so, edit the `manifest.json` file at the root of this repo and change the `name` property to your convenience.


## `manifest.json` file

The `manifest.json` file is here to provide a description of your plugin to Kuzzle:

```js
{
  /**
   * This is metadata to describe your plugin
   */
  "name": "name-of-your-plugin",

  /**
   * Define what Kuzzle version this plugin is designed for.
   * Use semver notation to limit the range of supported Kuzzle versions.
   * If not set, Kuzzle will complain and consider that the plugin has been 
   * designed for Kuzzle v1 only.
   */
  "kuzzleVersion": ">=1.1.0 <2.0.0"
}
```
